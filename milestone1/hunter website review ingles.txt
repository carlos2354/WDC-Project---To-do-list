The homepage looks very modern. This is caused by the increasing amount of  white space, big slogan and big buttons in the middle. It assists in focusing using my eyes and I am being attracted to the middle of the page. The top is beautiful too because it is clear. The logo button is only by itself at the side and it assists the user in finding it. The website assists the user through putting buttons whose functions are related to each other next to each other by the top.

The sign up page is not confusing to the user. It did its job well through asking only important information such as name, email, mobile and password. And so the user's workload becomes further decreased, it gave them the option to signing up using social media.

On the manager site there is no problem to understand. This is due to the operational buttons being vertically close to one another and them being grouped in one tab.

At the schedule tab. Because of the increasing writing, I struggled to understand. After all, only daily tasks are required, it will be to the marker's joy if one or only fewer days are shown at a time. It will further reduce the effort of the readers while reading (The readers will exert even lesser effort in reading it/ Readers will have no difficulty reading it.).
Putting the heart for tasks that are desired to do have made reading easier because of it being only an image.

The user site info is small and straight to the point (it only asks the important details), not an obstruction. The availability adds to the ease of reading because its using sliders and decreased the text.

On mobile websites, it accomodated to the small size of the phone through enlargening the buttons, there are no obstructions in clicking these.
